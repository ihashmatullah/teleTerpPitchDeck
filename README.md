# Pitch Deck Document

# Problem Description

In today’s world, everything tends to be standardized: people use the
same chargers plugged in sockets of a dozen types so they can use
identical smartphones to work, entertain themselves, communicate or get
information from a couple of identical applications. However, there is a
striking difference between a document edited in Bangkok and the one
read in Buenos Aires using an iPhone: one is in Tagalog, and the other
is in Spanish.

Language is not something we are likely to standardize anytime soon,
even though the global market is getting more and more integrated. And
as people from around the world want to work together or trade with each
other, the demand for translation of documents, memos, reports, manuals,
videos and teleconferences continues to rise.

From a certain perspective, it can seem that English is the great
extinguisher of languages and that people tend to consume ads and do
online shopping as happily in English as in their native language.
However, research after research shows that is not the case: everyone
seems to like, and connect much better emotionally, to their mother
tongue. That fact is mirrored by the business world’s tendency to
increasingly pursue localization to get as much market share as
possible.

In the business world, the demand for translation is everywhere:
companies have teams all around the world, they cooperate with other
companies whose employees speak different languages and they even want
to offer their goods and services in markets in which language is a
major barrier to their own. With the rise of the gig economy and online
work, more and more of them will try to cut their expenses and find
specific services for their specific needs.

The supply of translators, on the other hand, is more abundant than ever
before. The new generation of young professionals usually speaks
multiple languages on a professional level, and their skills could be
put to use. Translators who double as doctors, engineers, and lawyers,
not to mention everyone else, seem to be a rare and expensive sort on
the market as their skills are seemingly rare. However, today’s world
hosts so many freelancers, nomads, and even people looking for a side
job aside from their main profession, ready to bridge the language
divide for those who need it.

# The Innovation

We offer a platform that focuses on the translator and their service,
providing them with all the tools they need. On the other hand,
customers will quickly and conveniently find the exact service they
seek.

The customers will immediately know their translator's skills from the
reviews of earlier work as well as professional certification.

You can think of teleTerp product as Uber for language and translation
services, the process is very simple when customer needs interpreter,
customer opens our app and either select from list of on demand
translators or schedule an appointment for a later date, translator
approves session and then translation service is provided using teleTerp
platform conveniently and safely.

Note: For annual business and teleTerp commission (5% of annual business
i.e., 5% commission) only active paid/returning users for at least 8
hours per month of $ 25.7 / hr is calculated, I know $ 25.7 /hr is a
little higher but I haven’t counted one time business users’ sessions
with us.

Based on researching from annual user visit of <http://freelancer.com>
and <http://upwork.com> using <http://semrush.com> analytics website.
